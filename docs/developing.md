# Developing

First off, thanks for wanting to contribute! If there are any improvements you want to make
feel free to submit a pull request for anything. If  you are looking for something to add,
you can browse the issues and help work through any that are currently outstanding.

#### How to Develop

 * Clone the repository
 * Inside the base directory a dev_server.py file is included along with various docker files
 * If you are using docker, you can simply do `docker-compose up` and your dev server should be running
 * If you don't want to or are not using docker, you should simply be able to run `python dev_server.py`
 * This server loads from the sanic_crud directory directly, so any changes you make there will be reflected
 * Write tests (if relevant)
 * Submit a pull request
